Create an interaction.

Provided Files:
Assets provides the objects to be used in this interaction. Setup provides the environment, the setting of the interaction.
star in assets.svg is a controllable character that can be moved with the right, left, up, and down keys on the user's keyboard.

Interaction:
• The setting is setup.svg. space is a continuous downward scroll. The user can have the Star move downwards indefinitely.
• The setting is astronomical space with stars scattered throughout the background. The space has a gradient. As the Star goes downwards, it gets darker. When the background gets the darkest value it can get, it remains at that value.
• Objects are floating around in this space. These objects are the assets. Duplicate the Assignment II_Asteroid I.svg and Assignment II_Asteroid II.svg throughout the space.
• Assignment II_Stardust.svg appears three times. The other assets only appear once per asset.
• When the Star touches the Stardusts, the Stardust disappears. But right before it disappears, a text bubble shows up.   The text bubbles display the text below. The numbering indicates the duplications, and the style of the text bubble should be in the visual style of the assets and the background.

1.
Coral feelings emerging from the surface
With the falling sand persevering evermore

Here, where the blades did not pierce
Where the bubbles magnified vibrant frequencies
Where the ice was not so resentful

Here, where the switch was turned off
Where the envelopes contained handwritten letters
Where the bud showed signs of bloom

The flame flickered away at the slightest breeze
With the falling sand concluding its cycle

2. 
Sunsets over the lake
While the chiming grew louder

Warmth from the cardinal
It was almost like this second was the only worry
Was it folly for such a thought to occur?

The vase was full then
Now those glimpses wilt and hang over the edge
But miracles drifted around us

Waddling over noticeable cracks
The chiming announced its last toll

3.
Gazing into a fictional sea
Ethereal moments did not last forever

Somewhere within, there was a suspense amidst the saturation
It brought daffodil bouquets to urban owls
Overflowing with wonders, the forest slowed its chatter

From red storm clouds, the lyre’s song reached the roots
As space made its toll
Uncertainty was the sole figure who remained

Lyrics left unsaid
Ethereal moments were but a dream

• The same mechanic applies to the other assets, the Assignment II_Black Hole.svg, Assignment II_Dying Star.svg, and Assignment II_Planet I.svg. The prompts go as follows:

Black Hole:
Leaves of embers, descending into ashes
As the waves shatter against the glass rafters

The tug of the snapdragons remained alluring
Your perception succumbed to the absence of vision
High volume obscured those vital signals

Light’s rays crumbled to the dust
As the wise sought answers in the mirrored corridor
Declining into an eternal spiral

Navigating through breathing pages with veiled eyes
As the waves finally shattered the glass rafters

Dying Star:
Steel vines dispersed in motion
Crafting silently behind vacant conversations

The pedestals steadily ascended
Contributors disregarding the atmospheric reality
Merely lavishing the pools of rhodium

A rapid quicksand of sentiments
With unknown pauses left undeciphered
Yet the microphone was placed in our grasp

Childish automations in a clay jar
Scheming behind vacant conversations

Planet I:
Blank expressions across the canvas
Minutia enduring severed harmonies

Aquatic implosions disturb the horizon line
Suddenly the puzzle is reversed
For the threads tremble from the exposure

Noise covers the cracked eggshells
Fleeting whispers fade farther in the hallway
While the host is pulled away from the party

Five crayons scratch the pure tile
Insignificantly enduring severed harmonies

• The last asset to appear is the last stardust. The user may travel farther and farther down past this stardust without ever touching it, and the path will continue downwards with no apparent end, but there will be no assets and it will be dark.
• If the user touches the last stardust, the text bubble interaction occurs. Then after that, all assets that are still existent fade. The Star begins to glow brightly. After a pause, ephemeral text appears above the Star:

As night descends 
Rest befalls your eyes

Sleep, my child
To await tomorrow, whether sweet or dreadful

After this, the text bubble fades away. There is a pause, and then the Star turns into Assignment II_Star_REST.svg. Then, it shines so brightly that the light encompasses the entire screen. Then the light fades away, and where the Star was, there are sparkles. The screen is overlaid with a text that says:

PRESS ANYWHERE TO RESTART  

This text gradually fades in, and the prompted interaction does not become functional until after a pause after it fully fades in.
